The `langc-gpt-twit` code is a Python script that uses LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3 to answer a question based on a set of documents.

In order to run the code locally, you will need to have Nix and Python 3 installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory where the `default.nix` file is located. Run the following command to enter a Nix shell:

```
nix-shell
```

This will install all dependencies specified in the `default.nix` file. Once the shell is loaded, run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```
source .venv-langc-gpt-twit/bin/activate
```

With the virtual environment activated, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will prompt you to enter a question. Once you've entered the question, the script will use LangChain and GPT-3 to find the best answer based on a set of documents and display the answer.

Note that before running the script, you will need to obtain API keys from Pinecone and OpenAI and add them to a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository. Instructions for obtaining these keys are provided in the `.env.template` file.
